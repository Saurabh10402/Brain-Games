    <h1>How To Play</h1>
    <p>There a three different Levels to the Game. As the level increases the number of cards increases. <br>
    Each player chooses two cards and turns them face up. If they have same images, then that player chooses two more cards and if same again the player goes on until two different cards are faced up, then the cards automatically face down. Then you have to choose two among the faced down cards and repeat until every pair of images matches.</p><br><br>
