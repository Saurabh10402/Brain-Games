    <h1>How To Play</h1>
    <p>The Game has four colored buttons (Red, Green, Blue and Yellow), each producing a particular tone when it is pressed/clicked on.
     A round in the game consists when one colour button glows and produces a sound. The player needs to click the same button. As the game progresses, a second colour glows with different sound or same colour repeats, the player needs to press the previous button and the next button in the same sequence. With increase in number of levels, the number of buttons to be pressed increases making it harder to remember the pattern.
    When the player fails to remember the pattern and presses a wrong button, Game ends with a buzz sound and the score is displayed on the screen.</p><br><br>
